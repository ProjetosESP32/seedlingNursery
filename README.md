# Computerizing a Reforestation Seedling Nursery: font end web

###

This is (or will be) the front end web part of a project whose objective is to computerize the
reforestation seedling nursery of the Federal Institute of Mato Grosso.

This project is being used as final project of the discipline of Embed Systems, in the Computer
Engineering course.

###

Because my participation in this project will endure only the duration of the discipline, I will
work only in the first part of this project, that will be to computerize all the information about
the seedlings, seeds, matrix trees and shelves.
